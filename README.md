# Catmux

## DISCLAIMER - IN HEAVY DEVELOPMENT
This package is currently in early development phase. It's interface might completely change and/or
functionality might be moved around or even removed without notice. Use it at your own risks and
report issues and problems :)


## About
Catmux is a little helper to run a tmux session with multiple windows and panes with just one
command. It is inspired and functionally very similar to [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator), but without the project management feature which is in my opinion kind of an overhead.

Session configs can be stored anywhere and have to given as an argument.
